# Information Retrieval
Repository containing activity developed during the discipline of Information Retrieval and Web Search - UFCG in the period of 2018.1
During the course we developed the following algorithms in the Python language, such algorithms very useful in the area of data science and the like.
Are they:
1. Inverted Index and Boolean Search
2. Ranking and Vector Model
3. Expansion of Queries
4. PageRank

These algorithms were applied in a database of the Jornal [Estad√£o](https://www.estadao.com.br/). Whereas the dataset was provided during the course.

By Fim, a Recommendation Systems (films or news) project was developed, based on the [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com/) library applied to the data set [Movielens-100k](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/), the final project is in [repository](https://github.com/viniaraujoo/Recommender-system).
